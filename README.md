# Welcome to Clipper

Clipper works on top of [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli).<br>
- You declare cli into a yaml file just like specification.
- Clipper loads the file then initializes the urfave `*cli.App` and declares one interface.
- You implement the generated interface.

# Getting started
