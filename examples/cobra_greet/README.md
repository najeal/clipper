# Greet

Greet example is based on the [urfave/cli greet example](https://cli.urfave.org/v2/examples/greet/).<br>
In our case we generate a [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) CLI.


# What to do

Code is already generated. You can generate it again from yaml file using:<br>
```clipper spec.yaml```

Then run:<br>
`go run main.go`
