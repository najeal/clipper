# Exit Codes

Exit Codes example is based on the [urfave/cli exit codes example](https://cli.urfave.org/v2/examples/exit-codes/).


# What to do

Code is already generated. You can generate it again from yaml file using:<br>
```clipper spec.yaml > gen/cli.go```

Then run:<br>
`go build main.go`
`./main`
